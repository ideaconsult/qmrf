# JRC QSAR Model Database

In the regulatory assessment of chemicals (e.g. under [REACH](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/understanding-reach)), [Quantitative Structure Activity Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship) (QSAR) are playing an increasingly important role in predicting properties for hazard and risk assessment. This implies both a need to be able to identify relevant QSARs and to use them to derive estimates and/or have access to their precalculated estimates. To help meet these needs, the JRC QSAR Model Database is established and freely accessible through https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/e4ef8d13-d743-4524-a6eb-80e18b58cba4

The QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) is a harmonised template for summarising and reporting key information on QSAR models, including the results of any validation studies. The information is structured according to the OECD validation principles.

Download the QMRF Editor in order to describe your models in QMRF format and send the descriptions to `JRC-COMPUTOX@ec.europa.eu` to have them included in the database.
